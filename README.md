This is a practice repository for commonly asked Leetcode problems in coding interviews. There are many lists out there like [blind75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions), which will help you in  understanding the kind of questions that are commonly asked in interviews but I am using a list from the following [website](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/). The problems from blind75 may be repeated in previous list.

I plan to code the solutions for problems in the list in Java and add them on daily basis.

ascending order: to arrange numbers in increasing order, that is, from smallest to largest. Ex: 1,2,3,4,5
non-decreasing order: every element is greater than or equal to the one before it. Ex: 1,2,2,2,3,4,5

difference b/w ascending order and non-decreasing order:

If you have any number occuring more than once, you can not put them in an ascending order, hence Non-decreasing term is prefered.

Dynamic programming:

Dynamic programming is a technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem once. The idea is to save the results of each subproblem and use them to solve larger problems.

There are two main types of dynamic programming problems: 
 1. optimization problems: Optimization problems involve finding the best solution to a problem. 
 2. counting problems: counting problems involve counting the number of solutions to a problem.

There are two main approaches to solving dynamic programming problems: 
 1. top-down: The top-down approach involves solving the problem recursively by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. (Memoization).
 2. bottom-up: The bottom-up approach involves solving the problem iteratively by starting with the smallest subproblems and building up to the larger ones. (Tabulation method).
